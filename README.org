This directory is placed placed at =.emacs.d/$MY_USER_NAME=, where my =.emacs.d=
contains the emacs-starter-kit. It is used in two different setups on two different computers.

I am also bundling =eudcb-notmuch.el=, since its original repo went down.

The structure is currently something like this:
* =mail.el=: mail-related hacks mostly (now based on notmuch)
* =sync-com.el=: stuff for IRC/Jabber (now based on jabber-el and ii-mode)
* =init.el=: everything else
