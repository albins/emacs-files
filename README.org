This directory is placed placed at =.emacs.d/$MY_USER_NAME=, where my =.emacs.d=
contains the emacs-starter-kit. It is used in two different setups on two different computers.

I am also bundling =eudcb-notmuch.el=, since its original repo went down.

* File/directory structure
The structure is currently something like this:
- =mail.el=: mail-related hacks mostly (now based on notmuch)
- =sync-com.el=: stuff for IRC/Jabber (now based on jabber-el and ii-mode)
- =secrets.el=: wrapper code to load the actual, encrypted password variables using EasyPG.
- =init.el=: everything else

* Wishlist
- GPG signature verification for notmuch. I know somebody's working on it, it's just not in mainline notmuch yet.
- org-address interaction for notmuch
