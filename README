This directory is placed placed at .emacs.d/$MY_USER_NAME, where my .emacs.d
contains the emacs-starter-kit. Currently, I'm overhauling my config to utilize
the starter-kit, and I'm sure there's a lot of overlapping.

The structure is currently something like this:
* mail.el: mail-related hacks that don't fit in ~/.wl 
* sync-com.el: stuff for IRC/Jabber
* init.el: everything else
